# AmnioTrack: Revolutionizing Amniotic Fluid Monitoring




## Introduction
AmnioTrack offers a groundbreaking solution for continuous monitoring of amniotic fluid levels using advanced bioimpedance technology paired with AI-driven analysis. Developed during the E-MED HACKS hackathon, this project aims to significantly enhance prenatal care and reduce risks associated with abnormal amniotic fluid levels.


## Key Features
- **Bioimpedance Sensors:** Non-invasively measures amniotic fluid levels continuously.
- **AI Analysis:** Algorithms analyze the data to predict potential issues and provide actionable insights.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Users can view their current fluid levels and receive alerts through the AmnioTrack mobile app.


## Usage

The application provides a real-time dashboard which displays the current amniotic fluid level, historical data, and alerts if the levels are outside the safe range.
## Demo Pages

- **Main Monitor Page:** Shows current fluid levels with graphical history.
- **Alert Page:** Warns the user if fluid levels are abnormal.
- **Safe Page:** Confirms everything is normal.
